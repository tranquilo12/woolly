| User's Request | AI's Opinion/Improvement Suggestion | UI Opinion/Improvements | Impact on Codebase |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Rename "Documentation" tab to "Pipelines" | This is a good change that better reflects the purpose of this tab. The term "Pipelines" more accurately describes the sequential, multi-step agentic processes that are being executed. | Consider adding a small pipeline/flow icon next to the tab name to reinforce the concept visually. Also, update the tooltip to explain that these are "AI-powered workflow pipelines that process your codebase." | Low - This requires changing the tab label in the agent-panel.tsx file and potentially updating any references to "Documentation" tab in the codebase. |
| Reframe documentation agent pipelines as different agentic documentation pipelines | I agree with this conceptual shift. The current implementation already has a strategy selector that allows choosing between different documentation approaches. We can enhance this by making the strategies more visually distinct and providing clearer descriptions of what each pipeline does. | Add a card-based UI for selecting pipeline types with visual indicators of their purpose. Each card could show: 1) Pipeline name, 2) Brief description, 3) Estimated completion time, 4) Visual indicator of focus area (API, code structure, etc.) | Medium - This requires enhancing the strategy selector UI and potentially adding more metadata to the strategy definitions. |
| Set default width of agents panel and chats panel to 50-50 | This is a reasonable change that gives equal importance to both panels. Currently, the default is [20, 60, 20] which gives more space to the chat. A 50-50 split (after sidebar) would be [20, 40, 40]. | Consider adding a "maximize" button to each panel that temporarily gives it more space when needed. Also, remember the user's last manual adjustment of the split and restore it on page reload. | Low - This only requires changing the default sizes in the split-layout.tsx component. |
| Elevate the importance of the agent's panel | This is a good direction. The agent panel should be a first-class citizen in the UI. Beyond the width adjustment, we can enhance its visibility and functionality. | 1) Add a header with clear status indicators, 2) Improve the visual hierarchy within the panel, 3) Add a "What can this do?" help button, 4) Show progress indicators for long-running pipelines, 5) Add the ability to save and share pipeline results | Medium - This requires several UI enhancements to the agent panel components but doesn't fundamentally change the architecture. |
