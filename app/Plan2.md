Step 1/5: Proposed 3-Column Layout

## Index of Proposed Changes

1. Replace the overlay-based layout with a fixed three-column structure:
   • Left sidebar resizes automatically (up to 30% max width).  
   • Center chat area remains the primary focus.  
   • Right AI Assistant panel resizable side-by-side with the main chat.

2. Integrate a simple drag-and-resize library (e.g., react-split-pane) for horizontal columns:
   • Provide a draggable splitter between the sidebar and chat, as well as between the chat and the AI panel.  
   • Keep transitions/animations minimal and avoid fancy effects when resizing.

3. Remove or refactor the existing “pinned” overlay logic:
   • Deprecate the pinned/unpinned approach so columns remain consistently visible without overlapping.  
   • Continue supporting open/close toggles if desired, but in a more integrated 3-column structure.

4. Preserve the dark/minimal aesthetic:
   • Migrate all styling to ensure columns look cohesive in a standard 3-column layout.  
   • Retain the current color scheme, shadows, and any existing motion transitions on hover.

5. Maintain existing functionality:
   • Ensure that the sidebar still lists historical chats, the center column shows main messages, and the right column houses the AI Assistant tools.  
   • Keep all providers, queries, and animations intact, just repositioned in columns with minimal code changes.

## Changes by File

• app/layout.tsx

- Remove the current overlay approach for Sidebar and AgentPanel.
- Integrate or wrap children in a drag-and-resize container (e.g., two “SplitPane” wrappers: one for sidebar vs. main, another for main vs. agent panel).
- Preserve the Providers, keeping the basic structure of Navbar + three columns.

• components/chat-layout.tsx

- Deprecate the pinned/unpinned margin animations.
- Optionally use a narrower wrapper for the chat content or simply rely on the built-in fractal from the 3-column design.
- Retain framer-motion animations for minor transitions as needed.

• components/sidebar.tsx and components/agent-panel/agent-panel.tsx

- Remove overlay-specific logic (CSS classes, pinned toggles).
- Adjust them to render as standard columns in the new layout.
- Keep or adjust open/close toggles if necessary, but ensure they simply hide/show the column rather than overlaying.

• globals.css (and related CSS files)

- Remove or modify rules that animate margin-left/margin-right for pinned overlays.
- Add or refine styles for .sidebar and .agent-panel classes to reflect a stable 3-column design with or without resizing.

• Other relevant components (e.g., chat, main content wrappers)

- Double-check any references to pinned states or overlays.
- Optional: Insert small style changes so columns keep consistent spacing or small gliding transitions as needed.

Next Step: Step 2/5: Assess Scope of Changes
Compatibility with next step: These layout alterations are primarily structural and do not disrupt ongoing features like caching, memoization, or providers. They remain compatible with performance optimizations or future expansions.

Step 2/5: Assess Scope of Changes

With the new 3-column layout approach in mind, we will preserve the dark/minimal aesthetic while introducing resizable panes for the sidebar and the AI Assistant panel. The changes involve:

• Type of Changes: Primarily structural/layout modifications, plus integrating a simple drag-and-resize library.  
• Complexity: Medium – removing pinned overlay logic, adding split-pane code, and adjusting CSS. Some components (Sidebar, AgentPanel) will need fairly targeted updates.  
• Impact: Transforming to a 3-column layout will enhance user control and clarity. Existing features and providers remain compatible, though references to pinned states and overlay animations should be refactored.

Step 3/5: Detailed Implementation Plan

1. Remove or Refactor “Pinned” Overlay Logic
   • Deprecate pinned states in SidebarProvider and AgentPanelProvider.  
   • Update CSS to remove or override pinned overlay transitions.

2. Integrate a Resizable Library (e.g., react-split-pane)
   • Wrap the entire layout in two SplitPane wrappers: one for sidebar vs main, and another for main vs AI panel.  
   • Configure min/max widths (e.g., sidebar max at 30%, right panel max at 35%).  
   • Keep transitions minimal (avoid fancy animations).

3. Adjust Layout Composition
   • Replace overlay-based .agent-panel-container or .sidebar with standard columns.  
   • Remove margin-left/margin-right animations in “chat-layout.tsx” or replace them with fixed widths from the split-pane logic.  
   • Ensure the center chat area extends fluidly between sidebars.

4. Maintain Dark/Minimal Styling
   • Carry over existing background, border, and typography classes.  
   • Apply subtle hover effects from your current overlay logic to keep the same vibe.

5. Verify Additional Components
   • Confirm that dynamic imports, lazy loading, or memoization can remain in place with the new structure.  
   • Test that the new columns do not break existing user flows (like editing chat titles or toggling the AI panel).

Next Step: Step 4/5: Refine the Plan
Compatibility with next step: These changes streamline layout structure without disrupting performance improvements or Vercel deployment considerations. They can be further refined for clarity and minimalism.

Step 4/5: Refine the Plan for Simplicity & Modularity

1. Simplify the Resizing Implementation  
   • Keep each split-pane small and straightforward—no nested splits inside each panel.  
   • Minimize external libraries or custom logic so future maintenance is easy.

2. Retain Minimal CSS Adjustments  
   • Avoid complex transitions; the more direct the resizing, the more stable the user experience.  
   • Use existing variables (e.g., var(--border), var(--background)) so theming remains unified.

3. Validate Feature Parity  
   • Confirm toggling or “closing” a column can be done by setting the pane size to zero if needed.  
   • Ensure the chat, AI drawings, diagrams, or documentation viewers are unaffected functionally.

4. Keep Providers and Contexts Lean  
   • If pinned logic is no longer needed, remove those states gracefully, ensuring no side effects.  
   • Keep potential open/close toggles, but in a simpler form (e.g., a single “hide panel” state).

Next Step: Step 5/5: Final Verification & Next Steps
Compatibility with next step: This refined plan remains aligned with a minimal, modular codebase and sets us up for final testing and verification.

Step 5/5: Final Verification & Next Steps

1. Testing & Verification
   • Manually verify each panel resizes properly without overlapping the main chat.  
   • Check for any console warnings or UI shifts.

2. Deployment & Monitoring
   • Deploy to Vercel to confirm the new 3-column layout and resizing behave identically in production.([1](https://sdk.vercel.ai/llms.txt))  
   • Use Vercel’s analytics to measure load impact and confirm no major bundle size changes.

3. Ongoing Maintenance
   • Watch for styling issues or re-render loops once large code pieces are no longer pinned/overlaid.  
   • Continue to follow Vercel AI SDK updates, especially as layout or memoization best practices evolve.([1](https://sdk.vercel.ai/llms.txt))
